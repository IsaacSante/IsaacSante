Software engineer specializing in medical innovation products. 

Over the past three years, I’ve helped scale a digital immersive room from an MVP to a proprietary system used in over 50 hospitals across the U.S. I led the development of the video playback Python service for this product. I’ve also led medical R&D projects such as a macOS desktop app with Electron.js to display projected videos in hospital patient rooms, supporting a Mount Sinai Hospital study on the effects of nature-based content on circadian rhythms.
