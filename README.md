I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in creating cutting edge websites and immersive experiences that merge digital technologies with physical spaces. My skills include front-end technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript and 3D graphics libraries such as React Three Fiber. I also have a solid background in back-end development with Node using Express, and setting up databases with PostgreSQL.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at Studio Elsewhere. In this role, I develop software for immersive environments that combine nature visuals and sounds, aimed at helping medical staff recharge during work.
