# 👨🏿‍💻 Hi, I am Isaac !

Im a software developer specializing in Front-End, using React, TypeScript, and WebGL graphics. I've been working on creating novel storytelling experiences on the web and through interactive art installations. :telescope: 

Currently, I'm working as a Junior Engineer at Studio Elsewhere. In this role, I develop software for immersive environments that combine nature visuals and sounds, aimed at helping medical staff recharge during work.
