I engineer AI-driven innovation products. Previously at Studio Elsewhere, I scaled the voice-controlled immersive environment, Recharge Rooms, from an open-source MVP to a custom hardware/software solution used in over 50 hospitals across the US, boosting new product sales by 40%. Currently at Opponent Systems, I'm deploying a real-time video-based AI agent into popular communication platforms like WhatsApp & FaceTime, building custom computer vision tools to enable seamless integration.
